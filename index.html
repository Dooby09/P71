                    The food options and respnsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organised and more
                    efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meals
                    prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingrediants help both students and parents make
                    the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could
                    be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their
                    previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking
                    a box and playing for meals online can eliminate the fuss of money handling, making it safer
                    and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.

                    This infroms parents about their child's/children's activities in the school instantly. Once a
                    student reaches the school, the parents will be informed about the status via text messages. This
                    helps schools keep a record of the students' absenteeism. Students can mark the attendance by
                    logging in, and this is stored in a database, which can later be checked by the Admin. The tracker
                    has so much potential that it can identify which students are irregular to their classes and not
                    ready to establish connectivity with the actual concepts of thier curriculam's subjects. As soon as
                    you enter a student's Enrollment Number or Name, details like availability in classes, number of
                    lectures attended and will be displayed and no proxies are possible since the tracker is supported
                    by cloud capabilities. Even the security offered can be so robust and powerful that those students
                    who always fool their deans are caught in a shorter span- just after the admin enters login details
                    into this tracker. All this will improve accuracy and transperancy in any of the educational
                    institutions as students and their parents are pre-informed about the real time status of leave
                    requests and absenteeism in a confidential manner and at reduced costs.
